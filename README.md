# Hi, I'm Dat Vo 👋

## In the past 
I was a fullstack developer with React-ReactNative and Flutter as frontend tools, and Nodejs, Golang as backend tools.

I handled deployment with Terraform, Github Action and scaling with Knative and Kubeneters.

I was familiar with Google Cloud Platform.

## Currently
I'm self-learning algorithms, networking and high reliable system design.

I'm focusing on network programming with Rust, WebRTC, Kubernetes, Knative.

Happy to connect!
