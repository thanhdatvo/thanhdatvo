# Hi, I’m Dat Vo 👋

I’m a backend Go developer with experience in deployment using Terraform and GitHub Actions, and in building scalable systems with Kubernetes and Knative.

I have hands-on experience with Google Cloud Platform and I’m continuously learning algorithms, networking, and highly reliable system design.

Happy to connect!
